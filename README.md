# FlutterTheSpec

State machines, are a widely used tool for design, implementation and reasoning in software and computer engineering. Despite the ubiquitous nature of state machines, there are relatively few tools available to analyse their behaviour. Therefore, the main objective of this project is to provide an interface for editing such automata, designed with a multi-platform tool: Flutter. The final product will therefore be inspired by existing software such as yEd or UPPAAL.
